# Geomedia-Automation
Uses MS COM Interop and the Hexagon/Intergraph Geomedia SDK to create a python wrapper for working with the application. This provides a base for automation projects and repetitive GIS queries. Unfortunately, the wrapper is only half-baked as I no longer have access to copy of Geomedia to develop with but some of the basic functionality is there and working.
